# HD44780_library
  
  
Library is used to control HD44780 based 16x2 character LCD module via PIC16f628.  
Although most of other PIC controllers should work.  
Basic usage is provided in example file.  

Note:  
There is no way to clear single line. You should fill that line with spaces or clear whole LCD  
and refresh data instead.
